The UESI (Unified Executable System Interface) is a fully Open-Source POSIX operating system developed by https://github.com/rileyCloud and https://github.com/0x16000/
UESI aims to be portable and secure, while also trying to replicate original UNIX behaviour and functionality.

A monolithic kernel is also known as a monolithic operating system, which UESI targets.
